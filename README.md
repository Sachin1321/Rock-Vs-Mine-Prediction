# Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction
This is a Rock vs. Mine Prediction project. The Rock vs. Mine Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify objects as either rocks or mines based on sonar returns. This project will utilize a dataset containing sonar signals bounced off various objects, allowing the model to learn patterns and features that distinguish rocks from mines. This application is crucial for naval operations, underwater exploration, and ensuring the safety of maritime activities.

Objectives: <br>
* Develop a machine learning model to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines. <br>
* Achieve high accuracy, precision, and recall in the classification. <br>
* Evaluate the model's performance and improve it using various techniques and algorithms. <br>
